# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
This is a mini project named Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game, which I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is styled with CSS to provide a clean look, while JavaScript handles the game logic and interactions. Players can click on the Rock, Paper, or Scissor icons to make their moves, and the computer will generate its own move automatically. The game will then automatically detect the winner. This project helped me improve my skills in web development and provided a fun and engaging way to practice coding.
